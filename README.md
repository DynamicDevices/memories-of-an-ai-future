# Memories of an AI Future

> **AI Assistant Knowledge Base & Context Repository**

This repository contains structured memories and context for AI assistants working on technical projects. The knowledge is organized to be automatically picked up by Cursor and other AI development tools.

## Files

- **`.cursorrules`** - Concise rules and context automatically loaded by Cursor
- **`DETAILED_MEMORIES.md`** - Complete technical knowledge base with full details
- **`README.md`** - This file

## Purpose

AI assistants accumulate valuable technical knowledge during development sessions, including:
- Engineering best practices and lessons learned
- Hardware specifications and configurations  
- Build system optimizations and CI/CD patterns
- Security requirements and implementation details
- Development workflows and troubleshooting procedures

This repository preserves that knowledge in a structured, searchable format that can be:
- Automatically loaded by AI development tools
- Referenced across multiple projects
- Updated and maintained over time
- Shared between team members and AI sessions

## Current Context

**Primary Project**: MCXC143VFM E-Ink Power Controller  
**Hardware**: ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller (128KB Flash, 32KB RAM)  
**Software**: Zephyr RTOS with MCUboot bootloader  
**Development**: CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, remote testing infrastructure

## Usage

1. **Cursor Integration**: The `.cursorrules` file is automatically loaded by Cursor
2. **Reference**: Use `DETAILED_MEMORIES.md` for comprehensive technical details
3. **Updates**: AI assistants should update memories after significant development sessions

## Maintenance

- **Auto-Updated**: AI assistants update memories during development
- **Conflict Resolution**: Newer memories take precedence over older ones
- **Validation**: All technical claims should be verified against actual implementations
