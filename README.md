## Loading Strategy

**Hierarchical Context Loading**: Global → Work Type → Workspace Project

1. **Global Memories** (Always loaded)
   - Exceptional embedded engineer behavioral framework
   - Universal engineering principles

2. **Work Type Memories** (Based on project domain)
   - Domain-specific best practices and patterns
   - Technology-specific guidelines

3. **Workspace Memories** (Project-specific)
   - Current project status and key achievements
   - Technical details and integration points
   - Next steps and priorities

## Optimization Features

- **Token Efficiency**: Condensed context preserving essential information
- **Key Achievement Focus**: Highlights major accomplishments and current status
- **Integration Mapping**: Clear project relationships and dependencies
- **Action-Oriented**: Emphasizes next steps and current priorities

## Current Project Portfolio

**Production Ready (6)**: Meta-DynamicDevices Yocto (50-80% power savings), EL133UF1 E-Ink Driver, Sentai Conversational AI v2, MetaTrader 5 Trading, MCXC143VFM Controller, Kantar Firmware

**Active Development (4)**: AI Investment Platform, CAN Bus Tool, E-Ink Signage Driver, Radar Monitoring

## Usage

- **Automatic Loading**: Cursor integration provides seamless context
- **Memory Updates**: AI assistants update during development sessions
- **Contextual Relevance**: Only loads memories relevant to current work
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Optimized storage prevents knowledge loss
